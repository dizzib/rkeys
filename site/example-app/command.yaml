# example.yaml
#
# Commands are defined like so:
#
#     id: command
# or  id: [ keydown-command, keyup-command ]
#
# Commands can take parameters substituted into $ placeholders,
# where $0 is the first parameter, $1 the second, etc.
#
# Sidechain rules are defined as above but with the id
# replaced by a regular-expression /regexp/: command
#

# key chords denoted by infix +
#
# modifier aliases (like S+ for Shift_L+) are defined in ../io/command.yaml
type-an-asterisk: S+8

# key sequences
#
# integers 0..9 are digits, otherwise time delay in milliseconds
# a trailing delay denotes auto repeat
345: 3 500 4 500 5 1000
#
# separate up and down sequences denoted by array [down, up]
#
# explicit keydown denoted by prefix +
# explicit keyup denoted by prefix -
#
# emit 'Hello' on rkeydown and 'World' on rkeyup
HelloWorld: [ H e l l o, +Shift_L w -Shift_L o r l d ]
