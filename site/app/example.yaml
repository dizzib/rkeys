# example.yaml
#
# Commands are defined like so:
#
#     id: keydown-command
# or  id: [ keydown-command, keyup-command ]
#
# A command is comprised of one or more space-delimited directives
#
# Directives can take parameters substituted into $n placeholders,
# where $0 is the first parameter, $1 the second, etc.
#
# Sidechain rules are defined as above but with the id
# replaced by a regular-expression /regexp/: command
#

# key sequences
#
# integers >= 10 denote time delay in milliseconds
# a trailing integer denotes auto repeat
abc            : a b c
abc-slow       : a 500 b 1000 c
abc-repeat     : a b c 500
abc-repeat-slow: a 500 b 500 c 1000
